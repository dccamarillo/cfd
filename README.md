# Solving the Navier-Stokes Equations in 2 Dimensions
This Python program utilizes the finite difference method to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions, and then uses that solution, along with boundary conditions corresponding to an object of interest, models the laminar flow of a fluid around said object.
